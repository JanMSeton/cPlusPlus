Six major aspects of C++ not in C:
1: Namespaces, a way to make different functions with the same name.
2: End of line comment "//", a way to make comments at the end of lines.
3: Function overloading, C++ allows for functions with the same name but having different arguments to exist.
4: Structs with functions as members, we can declare functions within structs, making an object.
5: Operants evaluation order, the evluation orders of expressions using postfix operators,
 assignment expressions and operants of shift operators are defined.
6: Default arguments when declaring a function,
 a function can have predetermined default arguments which when no argument is specified the compiler can fill-in.
